I'm delighted to share that my paper **“Online Ensemble Learning for Sector Rotation: A Gradient-Free Framework”**  
(co-authored with **P. Polak**) has been accepted for **oral presentation** at the  
**6th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF ’25)**, to be held in **Singapore**.

This paper introduces a **gradient-free online ensemble learning framework** for **sector rotation** —  
a gradient-free online ensemble learning algorithm that dynamically combines forecasts from a heterogeneous set of machine learning models based on their recent predictive performance.  

The work was accepted for **oral presentation** with a **15.5% acceptance rate**,  
highlighting its recognition among competitive AI & Finance submissions.
