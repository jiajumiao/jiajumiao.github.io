I'm delighted to share that my paper **“Online Ensemble Learning for Sector Rotation: A Gradient-Free Framework”**  
(co-authored with **P. Polak**) has been accepted for **oral presentation** at the  
**6th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF ’25)**, which will be held in Singapore.

This work introduces a **gradient-free online ensemble learning framework** for sector rotation strategies, designed to adapt dynamically to non-stationary market environments without relying on back-propagation.  
It builds on my previous research in precision–recall curve (PRC)–based ensemble methods and extends them to **online financial decision-making**.

The paper was selected for **oral presentation** with a **15.5% acceptance rate**, underscoring the competitiveness of ICAIF as one of the premier venues for research at the intersection of **AI and Finance**.

📅 **Conference:** 6th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF ’25), Singapore  
🎙️ **Presentation:** Oral Session — *Online Learning in Finance*  
📄 **Authors:** Jiaju Miao & Pavel Polak  
🔗 **Paper:** [arXiv PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09947)

Stay tuned — I’ll share presentation slides and reflections after the conference.
